   * Global lookup i.e Lookup 1 & 2 will have N replication 
   * N is total node in the system 
   * Lookup 2 will give info about the SS of Object List Index metadata

   * KV in Local Storage Set will have minimum (1 + K) replication 
   * Max replication value for this metadata will be M, where M is total node in SS

This lookup returns following params which helps to identify SS of object
- Layout ID 
- Pool Version 
- Object ID 

**Note SS of object can be different from SS of this "Object List Index" Table**
